I've told you that I'm Lightning
But you keep hanging around
If Lightning ever catches you
(All right)
He's got to put you down
(All night)
About six feet

We bring this for the ones who fiend to see the truth taken back in pain
The weakness of this scene of fucks who lack the nuts to claim
The streets from which that real shit comes to put you up on game
What's your name? Check it, bitch, it's Death Grips
Gutter rappin', anti-sleepin', no half-steppin'
Low life creepin', high-def freakin' detonation
Set it off, no hesitation, audio invasion
But fuck that, can't thrust that to a beam, that shit had to go
Machine that lick and let 'em blow like cream, black
It's the magic host self-ream tactic
What the fuck? I mean that shit
(All night)
(Ride through your sk-sk-sk-)
Executors of that next shit
Nest eye to the left shit
That melt your face
Till your bloody neck gets ripped headless
Death Grips!
Bow down and take this what you get bitch
Rest in bits as I pace up and down the low end of the bass
Stomping rounds, automatic fire sounds in your face
Rip them fakes out their flesh
Come test this, get this straight, no escape
Rigor mortis, dead weight
Strung up and hung by hell-tensity drum
Bitch slap negative space
You thought that it makes through a cut
That bit only info can create
To properly uno, dos, tr√©s

(Death Grips)
Ride through your sk-sk-sk-skull

Took hit to the face
Dead weight off the hook, don't hate
Shook out your footsteps and put back in your place
(All night)
Triple X heat the rain in which we move
While they choose to get used everyday
Running highs you might break if their own reek of fear
Why you wish we were here
While I say, "Get the fuck out my way"
Fit to get cut by fist gut if you stay
Thought you was on top, but not no more
That's right, whore, we're fucking you
(All right)
Fucking you
Thought you knew we had shit locked to the beat street don't stop
Licking shots for the old school freaks doing the robot
Hear this devil spit next lower heat blowin' up yo' spot
Fear high drop to your knees, trick, you know what we want
That's right, bitch, best believe this that shit you forgot
Ever was, but it is through my blood, need that fix
(All night)
Gotta catch that but lead off that high head row
Give me the mic and step back, cuz
Need to rip that, watch me bust
Where you going? Not knowing till we get there
Jack 'em off of it
The sword what you're holding till you get well
Have to hit 'em off with all you know and got that gold that make it cracked again
Control this while I hold this enema death they set my casket in
Growing like oceans, epileptic sex, can't get past this shit
Spiraling too much, on like king of the cleaners liquid acid trip

What's up with that next shit?
It's Death Grips

Illegal spit fire bum rushing you're tired as fuck
Give it up, I'm here, look, don't touch why
We're done and whip that, fuck you
I'll cut you, don't try it, can't deny it
Cracks off every time that you bite it
Try to fuck when I don't buy it

What's up with that next shit?
Yeah! It's Death Grips

Try to board this train like
"What's your name?" Check it, bitch
Jack the rip in a brain
That's just shrunken head trip
What's your name? Tic-tacking
J-just status
(Death Grips)

Nuclear fallout flesh and fire in the hole
Death Grips is some thrash, it goes right through your sk-sk-sk-skull
(Told you that I'm lightning
Told you that I'm lightning)

(We are preaching our own funerals as we go through this life
Don't forget that)

Hit it, split it, make it cum, get wetted
Come again, come get it
Seen it happening before it even happened
Swing the door open and buck 'em down
Course I'm just fuckin' around
But nevermind the way it sound
Everytime we make it pound
Straight into the pavement now
Whip it, bleed it, cause it pain
Eat it, shit it out and change
Lanes at speeds that seem insane
To them petty pussy brains
Push me and they will be slain
Drag this past the point and claim
That shit as if it was your name
Like it's attached to yours with chains
Own it till shit goes up in flames
And there really ain't no one to blame
No one to blame, it's all the same
Like blurred faces on subway trains
Can't take it man, can't take the pain
Pain of the game
Makes me insane
Makes me fuck up my whole thang
Pain of the game
Makes me insane
Makes me fuck up my whole thang
What'd you bring?
Where'd you get it?
Give it here, I said don't sweat it
I'm gonna take it around for a bit
And I don't care if you give a shit
Punk!
I'm gonna take it around for a bit
And I don't care if you give a shit
Punk! Bitch!

Goin' through the motions
Just to make shit happen right
Never knowin where we're goin'
Just rollin' like waves at night

Make it or break it, just dont sleep on it
Sleepers get shot down, you lost it
Trying to act like you got it
Nevermind the way it sound
Every time we make it pound
Straight into the -  - ground
Shot it up, get it hot, what
I know you know you said too much
Did too much, way too much
Fuck that shit, man, that shit sucks
Volume turned all the way up
You already know it's going down
I'll tell you when I've had enough
Shut up right now
Feel it in my gut right now
Throw it up, give it up like
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, blow!

Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up

All over the place, all in your face
All up in it, talkin' 'bout can't wait
To bring it even harder the next
Time I creep through the beat possessed
Howling on that mountain peak
Feeling like hell's up in my chest
Feel the fire rise, rise so high, so high I rise
Eye to eye with death
Gazing through me like an uzi
Spraying through me, bag of flesh
Body bag of flesh
Ain't nothing left
Toe tag me, zip the bag and check it
Oh no, he's been resurrected
Oh no, he's been resurrected

Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up

Zombie holocaust in seconds
Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide
From what we know, down deep inside
Hell if I know, just wanna ride
Until the wheels fall off and I
Run off the road, no telling why
Hear them cry:
Man, I just don't wanna die
Just don't wanna, why
Is everything always happening
In the blink of eye?
This better be the last time me
Ever see you in my life
Steadily to the death passing
Everything that don't seem tight

Goin' through the motions
Just to make shit happen right
Never knowin' where we're goin'
Just rollin' like waves at night

Takyon...

Triple six, five, forked tongue

Subatomic penetration rapid fire through your skull
How I shot it on one taking it back to the days of trying to lose control
Swerving in a blaze of fire, raging through my bones
Oh shit, I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that's tight, what its like to experience - Takyon

Out of the blue, in through the back
Door coming through like fuck what was that
Man I don't know, but it made me feel so heated
How we creep without showing you jack
Shit from below, give a shit if you know
Cuz even if you did, you'd keep coming back
Back for more, need it man you're addicted to the heat
We make beats catch
Beat it til it bleeds to death, each track
Like EPMD snappin necks as we tap energy from everything on and off the map

Oh shit, I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that's tight what its like to experience - Takyon

Takyon, shot down your throat like a keg of beer
Choke on the smoke we in and exhale til the whole chamber is clear
Haters act so fucking weird
Try to stain this atmosphere
But they can't cuz its way too sheer
How to make a hater disappear

Take shit where it ain't never been
Fuck what you thought could not comprehend
This shit if I fisted your brain with it
10-9-8-7-triple 6-5-forked tongue
Criminal level crunk lightning storm
Get out the way or get up torn
Ain't a picture big enough to fit
What we dig up from the core
Of all that they forgot ever was
Militant march of this war

Takyon - taking them down
All we see is blood
Takyon - turning them out
How to trick out and freak that buzz

Oh shit, I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that's tight what its like to experience - Takyon

Lunar eclipse forcing you to trip
Off the moonlit fire we spray
Cryonic haunted bullets hollow tipped with toxic waste
So here's the deal, if you don't feel ill
Don't want it nowhere near my zone
That shit is dead, can't nobody get
With that shit gets dial toned

Takyon - bitch slappin pussy clots and clones
Takyon - settin off unibombs inside your dome

Oh shit, I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that's tight what its like to experience - Takyon

Known for it... Known for it

Known for it, been through it
Done everything I can to it
Road to it, til I broke through it
Never was attached to it
Took all I had in a flash knew it was bout ta crash
So I mashed through hit
Known for it
Had ta do it
Hacked into it

I pay the price ta roll wit it
Waste your life and you wont get it
Played out wit nowhere ta go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho don't it?
Don't it... Known for it
I pay the price ta roll wit it
Waste your life and you wont get it
Played out wit nowhere ta go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho don't it?
Don't it... Known for it

Let it eat shit and die
As I creep lit
Off the deep hits wit a sick mind
On the secrets I rely 'pon ta freak this

You can tell me what you said - go ahead
But no sooner than you said it
You can bet it was left for dead
All you said in and out of my head in seconds

Keep em guessin' endlessly
Never let em know where your headed
King of the unknown cloaked in mystery
How ta show em they don't mean shit ta me

Never meant a thing to me
Effortlessly dead to me
Check the sign no vacancy
Extremely selective memory

Known for it, gotta stay deep in the zone
Or it'll take everything you own, floor it
Get it, get it

I pay the price ta roll wit it
Waste your life and you wont get it
Played out wit nowhere ta go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho don't it?
Don't it... Known for it
I pay the price ta roll wit it
Waste your life and you wont get it
Played out wit nowhere ta go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho don't it?
Don't it... Known for it

Let it eat shit and die
As I creep lit
Off the deep hits wit a sick mind
On the secrets I rely 'pon ta freak this

Known for it since way back, all about it
Never been without it
How ta ride it inside out of da clouded
By the enemy surrounded
Thoughts that make you feel lost don't doubt it
You might just need it

Already did that
Can't never go back
Yeah fuck that
Gets the bozack

Laid on the gas, leaned back and blew it
Twelve gauge blasted out abused it
Left it for the next, hit eject done wit that
You want it you can have it, no questions asked
Left that shit on the side of the road in a ditch, don't trip
If ya have one let a man so I could flip a bitch and kill it

Head for the hills when it makes you feel
Like you can't ever chill no more, fuck it
Every time I get it ta wind, round my finger and recline
Behave or be slayed cuz I will be damned if mine ever decays

Forever on attack gut check the blind

Game recognize game is tight
Bow down or get banged for life

Cuz I... am... known for it

Been working way too much need to get out and get fucked up
Whats going on, where's it at
Make some calls to make it crack, lets see...
I need money, drugs, a ride
And a spot with hot ones inside
The mission:
To get all of the above in a limited amount of time
I can do this and it's done
Like that we're on our way
Be it acid on the tongue
Cocaine in your brain
Or some weed that hits your lungs
Like a runaway train
Hell yeah, from DMT to MDMA
Got all that shit and more
So 'til dawn we're okay... but anyway...

Fuck a line, every time
Get in, get a drink and lose our minds
All eyes on the dime
That makes your dick want to grind
Know you got a godd buzz going
Cuz everything is glowing
Skirt so short her ass is showing
And shes looking so you're knowing
You could get it tonight
But there's so much around
Best take your time do it right

As you keep getting higher
Lights look like they're on fire
Soon all that's left of you
Is your most primal desires

Ass clappin, dick suckin, lock the door to the bathroom ‚Äì quick fuckin
Find a whore and it could happen
But it's nothin, cuz you're drunk and you'll be blackin out
Before you even get a chance to think bout what you're doing

I want it, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yea, what'd I say bitch...
Bitch!
...

Getting looser and looser and losing yourself
In the groove that has the whole party movin
You're cruisin, you don't know what you're doing and you don't give a
Cuz you're so liquored up, you throw it up
And keep on riding cuz your timing is on
And that fine one is on you, its time to get gone
Too far up in it to yawn, til its finished come on
Get more twisted and bomb the dance floor til it breaks
Start to pondering rape
Me I'm all bout the face
But it takes all kinds
So pay no mind to the taste
Want to hear that song
You know the one with the bass
That makes their asses gyrate
Forget to hydrate
Til they're so fucked up they take
Off all of their clothes and whip
It on me like my body's made to fit 'tween their lips
You got the ones on their grill
Or between their hips
But either way I must say
I really don't give a shit
Long as its done well, and they promise not to tell
We could do this like an orgy
In the bowels of hell
Where every Lucy's hella horny
And their pussies don't smell

Argh... where's it at

I want it, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yea, what'd I say bitch...
Bitch!
...

Responsibility's cool, but there's more things in life
Like getting your dick
Rode all fucking night
By the kind of girl that knows how to keep her shit tight
Legs in the air, looking like they feel nice
Volcano pussy melt your peter like ice
And the drugs got you going back for more cuz you're like
I just can't get enough of that cum clutch, well alright

Its time to find one and take one
Right now
Its time to find one and make one say
I'm down
Think I just found one, bout to break one off
Meanwhile...

Hallucinating crazy, getting lost for miles
May have gotten too fucked up cuz I forgot how to smile
Gonna have to do this shit Jim Morrison style
Will it work? Probably not, but its worth a try

First hot one I see with sex in her eyes
Will be the hot one I need to take home with me tonight
Wish me luck, give me dap
And I'll talk to you later
And when I do lets hope my story isn't all about haters

Where's it at, cuz I want it like man
Got the drugs but need a hot one that'll make me go damn
Was the most banging guts that I ever have smashed
If you got it push it up on me cuz I'm feeling that ass, know what I mean?
Where's it at?...

I want it, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yea, what'd I say bitch...
Bitch!
...

Face melter
Cock the barrel, trigger range
Swerving donuts 'gainst the grain
I blame ghost rider, whips the brain
Kaleidoscopic bullet train
Never gave up, just a clutch
Bitch

Burn a bitch and burn that strip to dust
Dust to ashes, ash to mush
Mashed off the madness man, combust
Black magic flames race out because they forgot they can't get down enough
Low to the ground limbo, don't touch this merchandise, it's way too much
Ride the currents like a snake, wicked rhymes
Whirlpools I'll wade through haters, posers, fools, and flakes
Through this breaks the rules it takes
But I not just bump what you waste your time and money tryin' to chase

Don't know why you're wasting time, just know what I do with mine
How to do impossible things
How to do impossible things
What does happiness really mean?
Where to go when abrupt woken up from the dream
(Madness)

Don't trip man, just know we come
And won't even be close to done
Till shit hit the fan and make that flesh melt off your plastic face
Kill it till it dies, don't stop it until you feel that flatline drop
To hell and back, fuck yeah, why not?
(Why not?)
Smash till I break out, can't stop, won't stop, don't stop
Ghosts can't get caught, run it back, get cracked to the beat one time
Get-get-get back, keep in sync rhymes
Endorphins cashed by your own time
I'm coughing, the track freeze and unwind
Weed is of kind vaporize, freak man down from way this rides, how this rides
Feet don't touch the ground inside, I twist the rhythm pounds 'em on
How measurements of sound rewind
Forever and a day forgot
Forget to let it bang and walk the plank that hang from slang concocted to destroy the frame got bent by globe
This takes the pain in shock
(Ah!)

Don't know why you're wasting time, just know what I do with mine
How to do impossible things
How to do impossible things
What does happiness really mean?
Where to go when abrupt woken up from the dream

Execution makes it hot, electrocute the wave, the shock
To the brains of heads that came to watch us claim the game haters can't knock us
Real ones bring that bloody bass, we came to melt your fucking face
You can keep it, I don't want it
Back, my only inside pocket
All up on it, man get off it
Can't you see me? Best to drop it
Cut it, quit it, quick, next topic
How we fuck it off and rock it
Paradox knot, disco sock it
Can't unplug it with your logic
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it
Fuck it
And unplug it with your
Take out your eyes and watch it
Make you cry, feel like I lost it
Didn't lose it, never had it
Just another clueless faggot
Bound and gagged by fear
Too pathetic to be tragic
Get that shit outta here

Don't know why you waste your time, just know what I do with mine
How to do impossible things
How to do impossible things
What does happiness really mean?
Where to go when abrupt woken up from the dream

I can't deny I've not the slightest idea why
Even attempt to try
See them sigh
And settle with knowing barely enough to get by
Automatic supernova, so what? (Automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic)
We'll storm in the gates, subatomic
Flame drippin' onto this coal, setting hellfire to your face

Helter Skelter, face melter
Helter Skelter, face melter
Helter Skelter, face melter
Helter Skelter, face melter
Helter Skelter

I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship

And I know soon come my time
For in mine void a pale horse burns
But I fear not the time I'm taken
Past the point of no return
Wage war like no tomorrow
Cuz no hell there won't be one
For all who deny the struggle
The triumphant overcome

Trips to where, few have been
Out of thin air, upon high winds
Rites begin when the sun descends
Have felt what few will ever know
Have seen the truth beneath the glow
Of the ebb and flow, where roots of all mysteries grow
I am below, so far below
The bottom line
Transmitting live, transmissions rise
From the depths out of controlled by
Suspended glance of an unblinking eyes
Imminent gaze cast 'pon the path that winds
'Pon the path I find, and claim as mine
To ride the waves, of unrest
Made to make me shine as a testament
To why the ways of the blind will never get
Shit but shanked by my disrespect
Dismiss this life, worship death
Cold blood night of serpent's breath
Exhaled like spells from the endlessness
In the bottomless wells of emptiness
Channeled to invoke what we represent

Secret order
Elitist horde of
Creeping fire
Seizing power
Riders of the lupus hour
Eye on palm
Time is gone
Moonlight drawn
Fly til dawn
Sacrifice to rise beyond
Deep inside the violent calm
Of the coming storm
In blood sworn
To glorify and for life adorn
With all that dies to become unborn

I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship
I am the beast I worship

In the time before time eyes 'bove which horns
Curve like psychotropic scythes
And smell of torn flesh bled dry
By hell swarms of pestis flies
Vomiting forth flames lit by
An older than ancient force
That slays this life with no remorse

The spiral storm
Of flames inside
The torch I raise
The force I ride

Feel my vessel go up in flames
Flesh torch lit by thee unnamed
Direct connection to the source
Vestment of unnatural force
Forever burning black torch
Wisdom of the old and true
Possessed by the chosen few
Shining to reveal the ways
Of a darkness that pervades
All that is and ever was
Inferno of witches blood

Worship is not on bended knee
Nature knows not of mercy
To pray is to accept defeat
Power pisses on the weak
Bow and beheaded by the beast
Beggar on a bitches leash
Scum is desperate for relief
Worship is the way I ride
Witching currents through the eye
Of storms that force the false to die
Worship the flames with which I rise
Into apocalyptic skies

Harsh winds flay mine flesh to bone
In splintered skeleton I roam
Wastelands with not to call my own
But the path I walk alone
The hunger burns, within my gut
As my bones turn into dust

And I know soon come my time
For in mine void a pale horse burns
But I fear not the time I'm taken
Past the point of no return
Wage war like no tomorrow, know well there wont be one
For all who deny the struggle
The triumphant overcome

I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship
I am the beast I worship

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine - yah

Sit in the dark and ponder how I'm fit to make the bottom fall through the floor
And they all fall down - yah

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...
Guillotine - yah

Out of the shadows barrage of witch tongue
Cobra spit over apocalyptic cult killer cauldron smoke
Stomp music seriously - yah

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...
Guillotine - yah

Can't stop the groove lics jaws clear off them locks relentless raw movement
Fit to knock you from here to that g-spot body rock connected

To everything you want, ever did want
We got it why not come get it, stick your head in that hole
And watch me drop this cold guillotine death sentence - yah

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...
Guillotine - yah

Hidden art, between and beneath, every fragmented, figure of speech,
Tongue in reverse, whenever the beat, causes my jaws to call
Out out out out - yah

The screens flashing red, can't see shit but heads
Spinning exorcist like planets
Out of orbit off the edge
Off mine axis whipping through doors to far more than all that‚Äôs ever been said - yah

Tie the chord kick the chair and your dead - yah

Yah ... guillotine - yah ... guillotine - yah

Head of a trick in a bucket
Body of a trick in a bag
And thrown in the fire like fuck it
Gotta burn it before it goes bad
One too many times been disgusted
By the stench of rot is such a drag - yah

Get broke by the street like blood stained glass - yah
Choke on these nuts til the very last - yah

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...
Guillotine - yah

Serial number, killing machine
The illest of means,
To an end built on the filthy sound
you're experiencing - yah

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...
Guillotine - yah

Tinted windows, bulletproof
The slip knot fixin rope to noose
To the grave stone grinder of cold steel

The passion that blinds me so I feel - YAH

Can't let go, no it flows through our veins
Blows through our tunnels and rattles our chains
And they all fall down - yah

I fuck the music
I make it cum
I fuck the music with my serpent tongue

Wanna beer, have no fear, comes and goes, man its here
No one knows, feels so weird, when it blows through my bones
I got a jones for it
I wanna know more, cuz its bout what I got to show for it

I want some more of it
I want too much
I got so bored with it
I shot it up
Wanna light my torch with it and get all fucked up

What is it, where is it
How will it affect me
Fuck that shit, I need that shits bound to be the death of me
Fuck buying it I'm taking it, and sharing it with nobody

Cuz all I really need is some cool shit to mob
Like driving down the street to the beat of a blow job

I own that shit
On some throw back shit
You already know that shit
You even know 'bout how I know the man
Who grows that, bitch ‚Ä¶

You can't buy it with your money
You can't find it overseas
Its one of those things that seems outlandish
Til you have it's not a dream
As for me, I'm cool with it
And that's alright cuz it's my thing.

Work that angle til its beveled
Curve of the blade doubled
Edge made to bleed the struggle
Best believe the game's a hustle.
Observer of the strange occurrences
Conjurer of the subtle
Unseen but felt disturbances
That burst a bitches bubble

That‚Äôs right it's all mine
It‚Äôs all mine never was yours
Like how you wait in line
While I walk straight through the door
(straight through the...)
Hear you say something
But ain't nothing ‚Äì spectators ignored
Pay no mind to that chump's
Just a player hatin whore

I fuck the music
I make it cum
I fuck the music with my serpent tongue

Ain‚Äôt no fun if the aliens can't have none

How I fuck it dirty
How I make it twitch and scream
How it screams oh baby hurt me
Work me to the bone oh please
How I bend the rhythm over
And hit, hit, hit it on my knees
Give, give, give it up
I need it all the time
Bleed it on the drop of a dime ‚Äì down to pound it til it shines
Moonlit lake of blood red wine
Make no mistake, I makes it mine

Break shit down and make it grind
To the groove used to align
The cascading shades of jaded blues with these rhymes
Nuclear steeze creeps and winds
Through secrets behind and between
Every time I scream

Shit is mine
Its all mine
All the time
Shit is mine

What is it, where is it, how will it affect me
Fuck that shit I need that shit

Thought you knew, thought you thought
Thought you did but did not
Come on through what you got
Is it cool is it hot?

Check one two, man don't stop
I'm not through black blood clot
In my view like that twat
Spread eagle cross the block

Need no ego to rock
What we know just gets dropped
How we keep shit on lock

Cuz all I really need is some cool shit to mod
Like driving down the street to the beat of a blow job

Shit is mine
Its all mine
All the time
Shit is mine

Into the flame, into the fire
With no regard for a thing, fuck that I'm the lord of the game
I rule this empire

Lord of the game
Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt
Cuz no one has came even close to the train
Of thought we drop like neutron bombs from the tower

Control this and bang this, then watch it rise higher
Than anything seen in your entire
Life spent in chains, sonic live wire
Electrified rain from the lips of the driver
Whippin the wheel
Flippin donuts to peel
Out on the face of the base, where's my lighter?
Need it to kill one more and chill while I feel
It so much my gut burns like the tires
Movin this movement of real shit inspired
By all that has come before this and was done
For the real ones packin real guns loaded with power
Shower the slums with power from the war marching drums that have come to devour
The weakness that runs when we come
Fuckin cowards

When they tell you you must make it
And you think hell no
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it
Hits so low

Lord of the game
Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt
Cuz no one has came even close to the train of thought
We drop like neutron bombs from the tower
'Pon which we maintain
Like soldiers of fame
And fortune denied as to to get by without the
Bullshit coming at me from all sides
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Told me it was all good, but they lied
Don't wait to see whites of their eyes
Death to everyone who does not recognize
Wars never done, think it is you die

Where was I now
Like I said before
Hear someone knockin
At my front door
Who could it be, should I ignore
The knockin or see what could be in store
For me if I leave the safety of the shore
So many options, so little time
To do what I want 'fore the end of the line
Places its blade in the small of my spine
Is it paranoia, is it real?
How long can a man enjoy what he doesn't feel

When they ask if you can make it
And you don't wanna go

When they tell you you must make it
And you think hell no
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it
Hits so low

(Rather be stuck naked)
Than waste my time like the last time
And every time before that
Don't waste my time even one more time
When you know that shit is whack
Don't make me remind of you of the last time you
Said you‚Äôd never go back.

Fuck where you're from,
Fuck where you're goin,
It's all about where you're at

Triple six, five, forked tongue
Subatomic penetration rapid fire through your skull
How I shot it on one taking it back to the days of trying to lose control
Swerving in a blaze of fire, raging through my bones
Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that‚Äôs tight, what its like to experience - Takyon

Out of the blue, in through the back
Door coming through like fuck what was that
Man I don‚Äôt know, but it made me feel so heated
How we creep without showing you jack
Shit from below, give a shit if you know
Cuz even if you did, you‚Äôd keep coming back
Back for more, need it man you're addicted to the heat
We make beats catch
Beat it til it bleeds to death, each track
Like EPMD snappin necks as we tap energy from everything on and off the map

Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that‚Äôs tight what its like to experience - Takyon

Takyon, shot down your throat like a keg of beer
Choke on the smoke we in and exhale til the whole chamber is clear
Haters act so fucking weird
Try to stain this atmosphere
But they can't cuz its way too sheer
How to make a hater disappear

Take shit where it ain‚Äôt never been
Fuck what you thought could not comprehend
This shit if I fisted your brain with it
10-9-8-7-triple 6-5-forked tongue
Criminal level crunk lightning storm
Get out the way or get up torn
Ain‚Äôt a picture big enough to fit
What we dig up from the core
Of all that they forgot ever was
Militant march of this war

Takyon - taking them down
All we see is blood
Takyon - turning them out
How to trick out and freak that buzz

Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that‚Äôs tight what its like to experience - Takyon

Lunar eclipse forcing you to trip
Off the moonlit fire we spray
Cryonic haunted bullets hollow tipped with toxic waste
So here‚Äôs the deal, if you don‚Äôt feel ill
Don‚Äôt want it nowhere near my zone
That shit is dead, can't nobody get
With that shit gets dial toned

Takyon - bitch slappin pussy clots and clones
Takyon - settin off unibombs inside your dome

Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that‚Äôs tight what its like to experience - Takyon

Whatchya gonna do when they come for you
A gang of hatin pigs
What have they ever really done for you
Ain‚Äôt never done shit
Stash what you got cuz they're comin through
Best get rid of that quick
Cuz when they get here you know what they're gonna do
All they ever do is trip

Minding my own business...

Try to hem me up like for life stuck in the klink haters in blue
How they set me up should I test my luck, here they come they're in pursuit
What did I do? What haven't I done, you want to see my I.D. Umm...
Well ok, where I'm coming from?
Just on my way not on the run
Whatchyou want me to say are you just bout done?

Power trippin asshole lickin haters
Notice how they strut
Through the spot like anybody wants to see a cop, man everybody knows they suck
I got to be somewhere man fuck!
Why the hell you always stoppin me, round the clockin me like what

Whatchya gonna do when they come for you
A gang of hatin pigs
What have they ever really done for you
Ain‚Äôt never done shit
Stash what you got cuz they're comin through
Best get rid of that quick
Cuz when they get here you know what they're gonna do
All they ever do is trip

Six feet deep below the street
So they can't never say shit again
Fuck the man with a thick broomstick
And put a black flag on the end

Got to watch my back or just like that
I‚Äôm bound to get locked up
The law's watching me, constantly
Too close and way too much
Looking over my shoulder and checking in the rear view mirror
Cuz I'm never not but a moment from getting taken to jail

They're knocking at my door, down my door
They're shining lights in my eyes
Exactly what do they stand for
Ever asking more of I man why
Like it matters why I chose to ignore
All the laws I've been told to abide

Think I‚Äôm on parole, thinking I just stole
Some shit you got an A.P.B out on but no
You're wrong as usual hell no it wasn't me
Have the nerve to ask me if I'm drunk when I‚Äôm pissing in the middle of the street

Looking over my shoulder...

By the way why they always acting
Like they know how to size me up
Ignorant bastards coming after me
All the time on mine had enough.
Why they always wanna hassle me, pigs all up on my nuts
Like they have to be, like I can't see em
Trying to play shade tree in the cuts

By robbing me of my dignity
So in the end I never say much
But ain‚Äôt a time pass I don‚Äôt wish I could flash
On penelope like fuck!

Shot this for everyone who's been there
For my real ones who understand

What it feels like to have your rights read to you by the ...

Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

Useless information occupies every open space inside your skull
You know whats going on every day every night
Everywhere swear you're so international

Upside down cross on the Jumbotron
Wait up, hold on
Blowing anthrax off my palms
Say what, you're wrong

Switch stance, face plant
Napalm fire starters
Flatlander, plug puller
Nose dive turbulence chartered

You speak in abbreviations because real life conversation moves too slow
You're the media's creation, yeah your free will has been taken and you don't know
Choke yourself, fuck yourself

Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

Never seen without one hundred
She's a satanic priestess
Anarchy on ice freak flag flying faceless elitist
Crow on the down low end
Reppin' Orion's belt
Atlantis ancient vagina
Getting dusty on the shelf
Enter the pigs don't get it
No hands I'm shattering jaws
Double nickles on the dime
Fuck glam can lick my balls

Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

Whatchya gonna be when you're grown young blood?
Gonna be a mindless drone
Won't ever have to think
No your head'll be linked directly to your cell phone
The virus is alive, I can see it in your eyes
The infection is full blown

Career killer, double decker packed with suicidal brides
Four armed fury in a filthy dream about splitting your bitches thighs
Enters through unknowing eyes
Touch the key its in your mind
Can't delete it and soon you'll find
How bad you need it all the time

Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

Shiva slashin through your flat screen
Is nowhere for you to hide
Strangled by anaconda thumbs to the soundtrack of world genocide
My thoughts tie knots in silver spoons
Vampire on the rise
Punk a chump wit a cunt for brains platoon
In the zone and on the grind

Dead matter disposer from the mountains without peaks
Catch and release
Time released horse capsule swallowed to wake the savage beast

Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

Gotta get them outta here now
Infected act so weird how'd you get it
You're pathetic
Quarantine the virus

Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

I'm coming through, thought you knew, fuck if you didn't, fuck you
Plutonium lore
What this is, what this for
Feel my fists push black holes
Through your bitch ass decor
Split it back like a whore
And make you shit your fucking drawers

Scared to ride, cowards fall
Before my eyes, sound of my balls
Dragging like cannon loaded wagons
Drug by demons down your halls

Can't imagine whats fit to happen
When I get to flashing, see the small
Shrink to a fraction of what their lacking
And less than that in no time at all.
Can't believe they have the gaul
To try and act like they‚Äôre not trapped
Between these walls ...

Bring it, bring it, bring it, kill it

Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit - kill it

Sometimes feel like I'm close but never get there
NEVER GET THERE
Does it mean I'm a ghost if I'm still here?
WANNA LEAVE HERE
And if I am why can't I just float through the walls?
THROUGH THE WALLS
And if I can, were they even ever there at all?
NOT AT ALL

Too much time spent in the maze will drive you mad, I feel so bad
Been there so long I can't remember who I am, or where I stand
But in the end I guess I just don‚Äôt give a damn
Twist a gram and keep on sticking with the original plan
Fuck it man

Judge you no more than I wish to be judged
Even on the low
But I do know what you do not speak of
Don‚Äôt know but it shows
Try to hide but I see who you are because
I just know
Keep talking but you already said too much
There you go

How it is now's how it it always was
That‚Äôs on my blood
How it is now's how it it always was
That‚Äôs on my blood

Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit - kill it

See my blood spill drip, by chances
Try to chill, quit, cuz I can't just slip into a zagthoth trance
Tongue hissing, serpent chants
Come again work it in, yeah just like that

We paint our insides black
As the shadows 'hind our flesh
And make all that we lack
The part of life that we forget
All praise due to the fact
That we've forgotten how to sweat it
Check it
Bring it
KILL IT

On everything I own
Swear would rather slit my throat and die on the run
Than be the one who ends up hangin from that rope
Tied to the thumb of the man who comes to empty your pockets when you choke
Got to get that shit myself and get the fuck out of this game
Before I end up getting stuck with no one but myself to blame
All the way insane

Staring at the ceiling
In the dark
Trying not to let the feeling
Tear you apart
But the silence is buzzing
And it won't stop
Tell yourself its almost over
But its not

Known for it.. known for it

Known for it, been through it
Done everything I can to it
Road to it, til I broke through it
Never was attached to it
Took all I had in a flash knew it was bout ta crash
So I mashed through hit
Known for it
Had ta do it
Hacked into it

I pay the price ta roll wit it
Waste your life and you wont get it
Played out wit nowhere ta go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho don‚Äôt it?
Don‚Äôt it.. Known for it

Let it eat shit and die
As I creep lit
Off the deep hits wit a sick mind
On the secrets I rely 'pon ta freak this

You can tell me what you said - go ahead
But no sooner than you said it,
You can bet it was left for dead
All you said in and out of my head in seconds

Keep em guessin endlessly
Never let em know where your headed
King of the unknown cloaked in mystery
How ta show em they don‚Äôt mean shit ta me

Never meant a thing to me
Effortlessly dead to me
Check the sign no vacancy
Extremely selective memory

Known for it, gotta stay deep in the zone
Or it‚Äôll take everything you own, floor it
Get it, get it

I pay the price ta roll wit it
Waste your life and you wont get it
Played out wit nowhere ta go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho don‚Äôt it?
Don‚Äôt it.. Known for it

Let it eat shit and die
As I creep lit
Off the deep hits wit a sick mind
On the secrets I rely 'pon ta freak this

Known for it since way back, all about it
Never been without it
How ta ride it inside out of da clouded
By the enemy surrounded
Thoughts that make you feel lost don‚Äôt doubt it
You might just need it

Already did that,
Can't never go back
Yeah fuck that
Gets the bozack

Laid on the gas, leaned back and blew it
Twelve gauge blasted out abused it
Left it for the next, hit eject done wit that
You want it you can have it, no questions asked
Left that shit on the side of the road in a ditch, don‚Äôt trip
If ya have one let a man so I could flip a bitch and kill it

Head for the hills when it makes you feel
Like you can't ever chill no more, fuck it
Every time I get it ta wind, round my finger and recline
Behave or be slayed cuz I will be damned if mine ever decays

Forever on attack gut check the blind

Game recognize game is tight
Bow down or get banged for life

Cuz I.. am.. known for it

Been working way too much need to get out and get fucked up
Whats going on, where's it at
Make some calls to make it crack, lets see...
I need money, drugs, a ride
And a spot with hot ones inside
The mission:
To get all of the above in a limited amount of time
I can do this and it's done
Like that we're on our way

Be it acid on the tongue
Cocaine in your brain
Or some weed that hits your lungs
Like a runaway train
Hell yeah, from DMT to MDMA
Got all that shit and more
So 'til dawn we're okay... but anyway..

Fuck a line, every time
Get in, get a drink and lose our minds
All eyes on the dime
That makes your dick want to grind
Know you got a godd buzz going
Cuz everything is glowing
Skirt so short her ass is showing
And shes looking so you‚Äôre knowing
You could get it tonight
But there‚Äôs so much around
Best take your time do it right

As you keep getting higher
Lights look like they're on fire
Soon all that‚Äôs left of you
Is your most primal desires

Ass clappin, dick suckin, lock the door to the bathroom ‚Äì quick fuckin
Find a whore and it could happen
But it's nothin, cuz you're drunk and you'll be blackin out
Before you even get a chance to think bout what you're doing

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yea, what'd I say bitch..
Bitch

Getting looser and looser and losing yourself
In the groove that has the whole party movin
You're cruisin, you don't know what you're doing and you don't give a
Cuz you're so liquored up, you throw it up
And keep on riding cuz your timing is on
And that fine one is on you, its time to get gone
Too far up in it to yawn, til its finished come on
Get more twisted and bomb the dance floor til it breaks
Start to pondering rape
Me I'm all bout the face
But it takes all kinds
So pay no mind to the taste
Want to hear that song
You know the one with the bass
That makes their asses gyrate
Forget to hydrate
Til they're so fucked up they take
Off all of their clothes and whip
It on me like my body's made to fit 'tween their lips
You got the ones on their grill
Or between their hips
But either way I must say
I really don't give a shit
Long as its done well, and they promise not to tell
We could do this like an orgy
In the bowels of hell
Where every Lucy‚Äôs hella horny
And their pussies don't smell

Argh... where's it at

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yea, what'd I say bitch..
Bitch

Responsibility's cool, but there‚Äôs more things in life
Like getting your dick
Rode all fucking night
By the kind of girl that knows how to keep her shit tight
Legs in the air, looking like they feel nice
Volcano pussy melt your peter like ice
And the drugs got you going back for more cuz you're like
I just can't get enough of that cum clutch, well alright

Its time to find one and take one
Right now
Its time to find one and make one say
I'm down
Think I just found one, bout to break one off
Meanwhile...

Hallucinating crazy, getting lost for miles,
May have gotten too fucked up cuz I forgot how to smile
Gonna have to do this shit Jim Morrison style
Will it work? Probably not, but its worth a try

First hot one I see with sex in her eyes
Will be the hot one I need to take home with me tonight
Wish me luck, give me dap
And I'll talk to you later
And when I do lets hope my story isn‚Äôt all about haters

Wheres it at, cuz I want it like man
Got the drugs but need a hot one that'll make me go damn
Was the most banging guts that I ever have smashed
If you got it push it up on me cuz I'm feeling that ass, know what I mean?
Wheres it at?

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yea, what'd I say bitch..
Bitch

Pass that shit

Hold on man park the car
I have no idea where we are
Think we may have drove too far
Yeah I can see they're right behind us
But there's nothing we can do
We can't get caught slipping get off that shit and just be cool ... ooooh

They‚Äôre on to us but don‚Äôt look now
They think they‚Äôre bout to take us down
Fuck that I‚Äôm not going out
At the next corner turn left
Its time to handle this

I know where to go don‚Äôt trip
Have no time for that pussy shit
In a minute it‚Äôll all be finished
What you don‚Äôt think I speak the truth
You think I could just be sitting here
Listening to Sonic Youth?

Anyway when they try to ride
On you thinking I'm gone
I'll creep up on them from behind
And break them off one by one
And in the time it takes you to blink your eyes
Shit'll already be done
But just in case anything goes wrong
Keep your right hand on your ... oohh

So when they step up out the car
Yeah I know this sounds bizarre
But now I remember where we are
Do what I say and you'll be fine .. oohh

To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin while you're sleepin
Steady creepin, blood creepin

Shake the bottle, whats it hold
How many have I already sold
Hope not too much, cuz I feel insane
Need more than one to numb the pain

Slithering through my brain
Thoughts stuck on that train
Off the track and up in flames

Fuck it I‚Äôll swallow these blue ones
Yeah and maybe this big one
And I may as well take a few more with me
Just in case I get some ... oohh
Never know if they're gonna want some
Oh you want one? Yeah no problem
Got that covered tramp, I brought 'em ... oooh

How it creeps up on me so slowly
I don‚Äôt notice my eyes rolling
To the back of my head and falling
Shit, somebody's calling
Can't answer the phone
Call them back when I'm 'bout to leave
Can't think straight man I'm so fucking blown... ooohh

So when they step up out the car
Yeah I know this sounds bizarre
But now I remember where we are
Do what I say and you'll be fine .. oohh

To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin while you're sleepin
Steady creepin, blood creepin

Down the alleys in the middle of the night
I'm trashed, so high its hard to ride my bike
Might crash, whenever I'm this fucked up
Drunken monkey through the cuts
Who gives a fuck

So when they step up out the car
Yeah I know this sounds bizarre
But now I remember where we are
Do what I say and you'll be fine .. oohh

To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin while you're sleepin
Steady creepin, blood creepin

Get get get get
Got got got got
Blood rush to my
Head lit hot lock
Poppin‚Äô off the
Fuckin‚Äô block knot
Clockin‚Äô wrist slit
Watch bent thought bot


Tail pipe draggin‚Äô volume blastin‚Äô bailin‚Äô out my brain
Red light flash

Abraxas, hydroplane, massive
Catch this flight flow
Rainin‚Äô madness
Mastered mine and laced
The ave with black cat fish tailin‚Äô waves of stratus
Curb right ta far left lane

Don‚Äôt wait for me, if I care
Bout anything, anywhere
Losin‚Äô myself, I get the stares
What I‚Äôm lookin‚Äô at, wasn‚Äôt there
(Wasn‚Äôt there)

Nothin‚Äô out there
Can‚Äôt stay inside
Hit the bar, sleep deprived
Who drove the car
I‚Äôm still alive
Up in smoke, moon was low
How‚Äôd you know
Didn‚Äôt say I did
Whose is this, you know what this is.. but do you know


Fly inside out
Rot dem big shot simp slot shit but a one hit quick stop


So many ways

First got strange
Now I just think it life obey
So what comes next

Lycanthropic manic cycles
Fire water burnin‚Äô bibles
Wake up ragin‚Äô call a taxi

Cell light up yeah get at me make it quick though blood im busy (get busy)

Drilled a hole into my head
Pierced the bone and
Felt the breeze
Lift my thoughts out

Wit a pair of crow
Skeleton wings

Been floatin‚Äô thought
The nexus threadin‚Äô dreams

Deviated septum blow hole
Sugar cane ko ko
Aye, aye, pass the dro my way
Or no way twenty fo no 25-8

Grab my crotch, what's my name

Hangin' scumbag slangin'

Takin' no prisoners

Sprayin' execution witch fingernails clawin' through dem

Let me off, screeching halt
Concussion blinding
Not my fault
Ankles tied to cinder blocks
Aye, aye

By any means necesserated
Blade cut me
Sewer drain grated
Bubonic plague
Spreaded faceless
Lurking in the deadest spaces
On your knees, black goat anus
Christo anti clan of shameless
Came to whip those
Into shapeless
Here we go, devastated
Here we go...

Diamonds scrapin' the marrow, out my core
Who's in the mirror
Who's at the door
Someone's there
Wasn't there before
Ceiling connected
To the chord
Pull it, pull that sh*t

I got the diamonds, scrapin'
Sidin', wastin' my life
In altered states dem
Back it up


I got the fever 

(Lost boys...)

Other side of da tracks
Scuzz outsiders
Nothin' to lose
Strike of midnighters
Lost boys
True black and blues

Blood on barbed wire
Safe in your home
Gated zone terrorizers
Nowhere ta go
Far as I can get hitchhikers

On the road for lifers
Bullets in the fire

Running game on every thang in town

Weak tongue waggin'

How quick a b—àtch fit ta get checked mate
One false move'll get ya

Flat black chains rattlin'
Shawshank the box can't be contained
Man came ta pick the lock
Empty the vault and leave no trace
Sleep don't wake

Slow it down then accelerate

Cocktailin' sound bomb a snitch
Flat line of chalk drawn round the clock
Too many marks dropped ta count the stiffs

Stuck on the fence

And only never know me never will no son
Leave ya laid out ta fade out

Hustle bones comin' out my mouth

Hustle bones comin' out my mouth 

That can't wait ta blast
Blood stained knuckle brass gives a fuck sick wit it flav on
That ex con
Hard to da bone
Darkness from the zone
Mastered and pushed far beyond

Eons beyond the line never crossed,
By dem punks livin' soft while I ride that bomb
Dr. Strangelove
Into the sun
Look no hands megatons
Rode like man we can't lose
No shit, no shit

That hit it till it drip wit
Da blood of the raw way

Why doin' dirt, make slang sound tough gong original

Hell flame to your brain
Blood thirst

Deep space ghetto (streets)
Show me somethin'

Mystery hind that
Death door
Juke step electrocute the floor
What's the science on
Flyin' that high
Got a no-no goin', one time

Creeps up behind me
Over my shoulder
Turn around try to see
But it's nowhere
Noided, noided
Static on my blindside

I seen footage, I stay noided... I seen footage 

Everybody's knowin'
Where ya think you're goin' ain't goin' nowhere
Satellite, handle that

Who captures life
Who takes what's left who stay
On that next, already know my gillicutti, like I told you...
Don't touch me
What's up wit it

Desensitized by the mass amounts of shit

I've seen it, I've been it
Can't delete it feels like jail (noided)
Full moon in da klink shinin' don't sleep
Surveillance post my bail

I seen footage, I stay noided... I seen footage 

Armored cop open fire Glock
On some kid who stepped so
Fast was hard to grasp
What even happened til you seen dat head blow
Off his shoulders in slow mo
Rewind that, is so cold
Rewind that, is so cold
I seen footage... I stay noided

Juke step wit so much boy rude looseness seem like no bones in his skin
(Noided) my jaw hit da floor like this real for I gotta see that one mo gin

Ambulance hit and run over pedestrian in Brazil
Little tiger, boy soldier
Twist a cap back and kills (noided)

Seen crazy shit, man crazy shit...

Sink or swim, who fucking cares
Cut the birth cords, press send

Headed for the Sammy Davis wing
Throw up a black hole at the entrance of linens n things on the way
Never call it a day

Yinging and yanging noided

My stone wall its on dog gaze duct taped to the ceiling 
Stucco cave make me illi okay okay feel me 
I'm in an eight high abandoned building 
No daylight one midnight lamp lit twenty-four seven 
Murdered out windows two exits 
Street or nosedive to the next life in seconds 
And suicide aint my stallion 
So I'm surrounded 
Geiger count it not goin out shit's bout ta get kamikaze 
Fuck a nazi 
When the world comes knocking 
Fuck the world fuck this body

Mood in my tomb red moon heavy 
Sling jaw shot out the window and yell 
Come up and get me

Think you got what it takes 
Come up and get me 

Can't tell hell in my head 
Thirteenth bell am I dead 
Or in asylum pill force fed 
Lyin to myself all by myself 
Strapped down to my bed 
Tongue cut out the mouth of reason 
And chucked off the rivers edge 
Think fast is it tear gas or fear masked 
By figments of my fragmented mind 
Who's my enemy them or me 
Step to me and you'll die 
Grand delusions magnified 
Fuck the truth wastes my time 
Its all good bet whats that 
Footsteps on the stairs 
Never could rest they're always there 
Who are they I don't care 
I just know they're tryin ta x me 
Give a fuck, come up and get me

Burn through it burn through it

Broken hands on all my fingers 
Buckle down my knuckles like screamers 
Stitch up my blown out trench with leather streamers

Warm piss showin through his cheap slacks this bitch is done 
Open my front ragin like I've never slept 
Make him cry like a baby formula on the breath 
Needle of your eye lil boy

Lucid nut shake shake it up

Pinhole pic of my wingspan jail breakin doubt 
Highest vibration ninth ring of fire crowned 
War cry feel my call hear my chamber revolve 
In your brain like the halls of Amenti 
Treat a bitch like a whore 
Leave your pink sock at the door 
Saturn level flexed

My life on a limb about to break 
I'm a tower pon tectonic plate

Load your cannon shutter flash heavy damage

Blow out the lights take your life 
Ride the falling sky with me 
Falling inside of me 
Its all suicide to me 
World of dogs

World of dogs gone mad 
Above the law in your ass 
Fire trash meltdown I'm not here

Don't tell no one no one can know come closer 
I'm almost over lower sinkholer 
I'm nothing feed me to this world of dogs 
Barely breathing in this world of dogs 
Foam of feral reality forming on mountains of teeth 
Devour the hand spit out the leash 
Crown the beast my thrones the street 
Too cold to sleep I kill myself I feel no pain 
I'm obsolete 
World of dogs

I got some shit ta say just for the fuck of it
Them thangs them thangs don't even ask me

Corner of my eye the coroners here why under pressure I

My back bone slip left to the death
Massive procession of cold sweat
Stalactite step slide through you're next
Get me inside I'll do the rest

Master of self contained combust
Sustained disgust command him claim
Figure eight strut can't be touched
Subversive infiltration reign supreme in none me trust
Why must them fuck them

Mine vomit stain dem feel not but hate dem
Line up back facin suspense rapes dem
One by one hot cum shot clip spray dem
Life drop and waste dem in pine box laid dem ta
Grime dismantled churn the fat
Light the candle burn the wax
Before me dies in scorch uprise
Can't deny it no way back

I got some shit ta say just for the fuck of it
Them thangs them thangs don't even ask me

Invoke ancient locc to the brain in a blaze ignition weightless world
Warped rotation path is blurred memento mori dead mans curve

Oblivion transcender becomes him shroud
I can't remember I'm no one now
Comin for yours lock your doors
Identifier destroyer

Comon stick me cut me drain me suck me drink me take me down
Feel me one three make your chamber pound and drown

I got some shit ta say just for the fuck of it
Them thangs them thangs
Don't even ask me

Bear the mark take one to know lifted chin face don't show

Whammy 

I get off and rid of em 
I nail the coffin lid on em 

Whatchyou want some don't want none your 
Number one is my two dollar whore 
So whatchyou bought that for 
Why you wanna rock that for 
Come here drop much more 
Slow down turbo look down vertigo 
Turn around where'd she go 
Wah tried ta slip alpha bone game 
Whammy 

Knew you had it comin grabbed your plum and your gomez 
Even though I said don't go there thats hoe flair 
Don't be a bitch and you know thats not even on the low can't see check the kodak 
Who me yeah you feel me climbin out your stomach 
Gettin queazy easy does it can't help yourself suck it 
Whammy 

I get off and rid of em 
I nail the coffin lid on em 

Collar popper hollar but all I hears nada 
All this talk about dollars need ta stop real quick 
Real shit aint prada you lost it you slipped 
Musta forgot who dis 
Whammy 
You're reaction I-man the cause 
I'm buyin land and gun while you're at the mall 
Big man is small man wit a tall can of flaws 
You're head in my hand my hand in my 
Whammy

My moods live on that swing same
Push me harder push me push me swang into tomorrow

Gawk as I thread this loch ness slipstream sepsis
Subconscious up f twitch asterisk see off my meds glitch
Thoughts squealin through my mildew watch my back or I'll kill you
Schizo superscript scan the voice imprint only I can hear you
Deserted mansion in my head half-lidded lanterns returnin
Sclera scarlet as wall of virgin bombed by flask of bourbon
Can't be certain
Your intercom I'm fingering you don't wanna but you buzz me in

My moods live on that swing same
Push me harder push me push me swang into tomorrow

Nathan perculatin proper
Caiman propellers comin off she's hella copter
My neck bone sprayin guava
Shimmy snakin status caved in mental state been shanked and soldered
I got the nasty in my taxi you need a lift
You can sit between the backseat and my dick
If the law catch me in the act and I happen ta die today
Push one my swing out in a glass of purple rain
Candy painted by the lord of stainless steel liquid your ashy brain

My moods live on that swing same
Push me harder push push me swang into tomorrow

I got that feeling somebody killed me
I got that feeling zero feeling
Can't stop stealing zeros killing all your millions
Somebody kill me somebody killed me
I got that feeling zero feeling
Can't stop stealing zeros killing all your millions.

Both ends of my candle countin paces
Never stop chasin each others faces
I'm the mask that separates them
Bridge their sole desires cravin
Don't make me take my face off
Show you why I hate soft
Let flock of sheep get shaved off
Lynched by their halos

Call me crazy but I swear my lines been tapped
In my glass house prepared for surprise attack
Realized I held the blade inside my back
Omega megalomaniac
In my glass house prepared for surprise attack
Realized I held the blade inside my back

I'm the coat hanger in your man's vagina
Manic downstroke on fire
Beat it bitch all black can't fade it
Beat it bitch I came ta brang it
Fuck bourgeois ODB raw
Your pearl white teeth my Yellowman jaw
Say only what you think I know you should
Hate myself more than you ever could

Call me crazy but I swear my lines been tapped
In my glass house prepared for surprise attack
Realized I held the blade inside my back
Omega megalomaniac
In my glass house prepared for surprise attack
Realized I held the blade inside my back

No footprints in this bleach I tread them don't know yet but thats expected

Caved in my ribs drug out fucked out Samhain skid off bay bridge
Come with me and I'll unhurt you
Keep all I do locked kept your move

Should we be worried what I'm not

Trend setter maximum third planet from the sun orbit my lungs
Bulldozin cul de sacs ground under over every act
Cut no slack no slack

Rage stormin off the chains remind me of rape house slave cock rings

Pop tramp on that jigaboo goddamn I'm so sick of you

Inanimate sensation
Vantage perspective from objective it came from
Inanimate situation
No relation close liaison
No conversation, no social contagion
Bother me, wanna be comrade intrusive
I remain
Inanimate aloof skip
Counterfeit
Like no can do bitch

My vinyl vibrate higher than you, bitch
I represent, ain't meant to pursue which
One of you, oh you all wanna ride, well I ain't got room stress
While we continue to make shit tight the loosest

Blown out
Base

You got a minute
You're in my way
What's wrong
Wrong with who
So what's going on
Okay
Where you at right now
I'm not with you
Inanimate persuasion
Strictly still life with all of my occasion
Inanimate surge of inspiration
Glow like thermonuclear invasion
Compared to swapping thoughts regurgitation
I revel in lack of slightest acquaintance
No rancid level after taste inanimate negate opinion
As it unravel like enigmatic onion
Layers of interdimensional dominion

Blown out
Base

Yeah, bitch
My smoke, my butane
My boots, my headphones, my medicated noose
My deadroom, my schwartzwald hat, my Mac
My macaque skull, my lysergic stash
Empty streets at night, my bike
Apartment sink filled with dry ice
Condemned tenement, brandished rail spike
Disturb in flat noir and stale white
Grey cloud curled around my bearded compound like boa
One of two thunderbolt we ain't broke on tour
Concr√®te antique trapdoor twenty-four
Spots to get that get right
When I gotta get right some more
Type of get right I can't afford
I covet these things more than any living
I've never been

Blown out
Base

I'm so Northern California, I call scratch "bammer"
Pure overhander
Live show on a banner
Axl Rose in a blender
Slash on Satan's fender
Rick James on the cover
Running through your lover
Like mean Mr. Mustard
Stadium style
For those who came to jock
Watch that man salute you
Endless nameless Lady Godivas we snoop to
Like eighty-three mermaids in Brooklyn Zoo
Inanimate ghetto box we used to pimp through

Blown out

Inanimate fixation
Obsessed with my demo tape collection
Inanimate riffs I'm glazin

I'm smoking cigarettes in the shower when they get wet i just light another
Fatal cardiac over cancer don't gimme no suffer
Steal me over feel me linger until i'm six under
Ain't a fucking thing sacred when i get naked

I'm lighting up like Vegas
All sevens king of pentacles
I'm chaining like its money dirty money surgeons general
As if my flesh keeps me prisoner
As if
I've been spinning chambers since the day I was born
Like whats it all for
Like why the fuck not
Fuck if I don't get off I don't know how to be caught

I'm turned off
Pah pow pah pow
I'll fuck you off at no cost
You're turned off
Pah pow pah pow

I'm turned off won't be back soon
Look up see my nuts slap the moon
I'm turned off like a myth
Can't look me up i don't exist
I spin the chamber tween my lips
I pull the trigger like a giff
I can't get hit I've never lost
I'm a rumor I'm turned off

My footprint precedes me follow me
I'm all the way over my species
My footprint so dropped it's bottomless
Species call my redwings apocalypse
You want this bitch i drop a bitch
Snuff your bloodclot metropolis
Trail of anonymous casualties
Pah pow boom mastery
I've been over that glass house
All my windows blacked out
Straight jacked up the fuck up
Guts up man down
My man stand down
I'm not with it
I drop liquid
Red light district
Can't be finished
You never started
You run for martyr
While I'd push harsher

I get off at all cost

Pah pow pah pow
I'll fuck you off at no cost
You're turned off
Pah pow pah pow

Take off my shirt cause it hurt form of murder
Art of indifference trump consequences
Like first off I'm turned off
Pah pow pah pow

Trust me you can't trust me try trust me you'll see why
When I see you through the ringer my ringer catch deuce deuce
I repeat like pi my ringer catch deuce deuce divided seven times
I'll lead you to where am I
I get off at all costs
I'm turned off
Pah pow pah pow
I'll fuck you off at no cost
You're turned off
Pah pow pah pow

I get off at all cost

Try and tame me I dare you
Try and tame me how you dare you

Obviously
I laugh when you ask if you're under my spell
Obviously

Obviously
My touch tied to strings that steer my figures inside out their wax
You pour I swill you're false like tears, priceless to feel my subjects crack

Why a bitch gotta lie? 

Try and tame me I'll redirect

Why a bitch gotta lie? 
(Why a bitch gotta lie?) 

Try and tame if you're so sure
Ain't dead or alive, ain't wore this floor
My floor tremble your voice
Silencer
I make your choice
I make no excuses, just fucking noise
Try and tame me maybe not up to you because
Can't tame me I'm proof of
Fuck you gonna do, scream?

I saw you doing peace signs with the F.B.I
Might've tried that in the future before so don't lie
All dead dogs go to heaven cause the bitches let them in
They're just racist and they wanna fuck
God chills out cause she doesn't touch
This is where I don't come in
This is where I have been maybe
Have a sad cum, baby


I fuck it out and I dip-dip-dip
Drop you like asses and you trip-trip-trip
I can't stop it when I drip-drip-drip
You can't stop it when you drip-drip-drip
I piss on your face like I'm PSS-PSS-PSS
You lick up the place like you're PSS-PSS-PSS
We pick up the pace like we're PSS-PSS-PSS
I'm the fuck you're chasing like PSS-PSS, PSS-PSS, PSS-PSS

My shit's been retarded since beginning of time
I'm up in your body like sickest one line
I'm the only thing ever on my mind
You're one of those things I never rewind
I'm coming out your pocket like carving pools
With my jewels
I'm throwing heebie jeebies like iTunes
The cars that go boom
These are my gold bars melted on spoons
My junk hits like martial law
You nod like true



If I were her and she was him we would go and fuck ourselves again and again
Life is very dangerous and it wants to rearrange us like your friends, like the end
Show me into Target and I'll show you how I bought it with my mind in my mind
Touch it out in the parking lot, fuck me while the whole world watch us waste our time



I can't know what I'm bout to do
I'm what the fuck happens


I've got the powers that B
Running through me
My favorite color is oh my god bitch
I'm wearing black gloves through your mall I'm rich
You wanna check my pockets but

I'm what the fuck happens when shit happens
When a fuck gives under no circumstances
Off your clock shit memory persist a clock shit
Lick lick a shot shits cracking
I'm when shit happens cause i'm not acting
Like it like it or not I'm on that shit you're not
I'm this ceremony I gouge you till you're free
As my testimony to the powers that b
I can't know what I'm bout to do
When i can't know what I'm bout to do
I'm what the fuck happened
And i can't know what I'm bout to do
Until its too late for you
To steal my name bow down on cue



I got on my shit kickers
Smoke coming out my fingers again
Can't fuck with the physical world
Cause i comply with the powers that b
I'm never over right now
My stretchers rollin I'm in the white house
The black light house I'm above this life now
I'm beneath me
Raised on short notice by the powers that b
Hook me catch me squeal me in
Gut me hack me crop your grin
Pack me sell me claim we're friends
See me on the street drop your grin
Squint your beady eyes and flinch
Like a sniveling shiesty snitch
Don't fret I know you're just a bitch
I get paid by the universe
Morbidly blas√© when I'm not on display
Turn up my mic your hair turn white
I get paid by the universe
I'm on salary
You get no fucks from me
I run the company
On the powers that b
I get paid by the universe



No I ain't shit and I like that
You want a statement i'm like why's that
You're parasites showing thats not my bad
You're bads pathetic your bads your price tag
Your bads embedded in your lives a white flag
A sterilized white flag born bred and buried in it
Wears you like a cherry finish keeps you valuable and shiny
You're a shiny clown to me and the powers that b

Canopy of corpse tree, branches loom above me
Vacuum of crushing, doom lies before me
My future dies behind me, my entry aborts me
I lean back and drill me, like on me I'm feeding
I'm starving, I hardly ever feel like being


Frightened people, you know who you are
Cowards, we know what you are
Play your fucking part, I'll bleed my fucking heart dry
Cause I feel so alive, beyond alive
I'm beyond alive 

Fuck I have's, all I need
Fuck I can's, all I bleed
Fuck I am, ever will be
I rise, I fall, I roll again
I have no age, I don't pretend I'm here
My absence stains me sketch gets weird
I thrive on empty

Can't predict me with them petty such a pity
My peak keeps rising they keep sinking
Into lakes they're crying I keep spitting
Wish I could see them dying, but my peaks too fucking misty
Tilt your lump, till back of your brains tween your weak slumped shoulder blades
Still can't scope peak I pave into oneway street to space
Grovel in gravel at my base, while saddle control you seek
This world of cattle at my feet, born to get put back to sleep
At my feet, born to get put back to sleep



I roll like I don't know no better
I roll like bitch you know better
You have my utmost disrespect
I'm high as fucked up get

I crash on bed of nails in my frail suit of scabs i relax
While having seizures in my shack
I take no breather, I took the pact
I grind this stone into my path
I wait for you in this disguise
Remorselessly beyond alive
Beyond alive



My life as a face without eyes
Look away, look away, look away, look away
No reply I'm beyond alive 

Fuck the sun, fuck its kind
Daylight sucks, waste of mine
I fuck my mind, narrow my mind
I bide my time like fuck in place
One day, I'll wave sun to ice
Watch its kind get thrown like rice
My cackle stretch out like thunder
So fucking loud, it's vulgar


I pull my face out the dirt slow
These days I only wake up third of the way, narco
Held to deep rapid eye move, hold
These days I recede, rapid I reload
Gun my chances closed road, no road left to travel

I know what this calls for
Where's my scalpel? Operation cut
Like I'm bored sew my inner war up like corn, rows
My internal war blows like freezing fog in Oslo
Frozen I can't get soft, baptized in hoarfrost
Like carbon monoxide garage
Freeze your blink with sandman's flush
I hate you so much
I hate your laws
I hate your need a cause
I hate your faux touch
I hate every last one of you
I ponder digesting razors just to be done with you
I love you so much

I'm triple the motherfucker
Mondo fisted, full of backwards
From banana town manor
My slang step like legless lizard
I fuck around, fashion a rocket
Shoot to Mercury, for the winter
Extended vacation till I decompose on my splinters



To centuries of damn
I've never been so yawn
Can't believe I'm still standing
Can't believe life take this long
I stagger off to find my lighter
I don't return until the day Sad A validates
Mankind's destiny in a worm

By the way, I don't pet bleachers
Court side to nose bleeders
Like I shoot shit with gimps
No response, losem' once
Incoming second attempt
To be real, I just shoot 'em up (just shoot 'em up)
Them clueless strut nailed to crucifix lilith shoved up her cunt (shoved up her cunt)

Fuck



I'm fucking tired of all the perks
I've tried nothing, everything works
For less I'm worth, I've served my bid
All fuck life wasn't what it is
All fuck life was just a bridge
I seen some free landed some tricks
Far I see high time man quit
Won't let you know when I get goin
Phone ring too long

Phone ring too long, I'm probably gone
Ring tone jingle my swan song
I'll show you how to leave well enough alone
I'm not this world this on cue world
I fall back, concoct new worlds
I fall out in throbbing swirls
I fall until I stop this world
I fall the fuck off this world
I live down the street from you've noticed me, I've never seen you
Wonder what the fuck I do
Listen up, you nosy bitch, listen close
My most recent purchase, old black rope
Gonna learn how to tie it, hang it in my chamber
Perfect reminder occult I'm made of
Come try it out whenever you wanna
Last night, 3:30 in the morning, Death on my front porch
Can feel him itching to take me with him, hail death, fuck you waiting for
Like a question no one mention, he turns around, hands me his weapon
He slurs, "Use at your discretion, it's been a pleasure, Stefan"
Head on like dead, on like grey
Death in your way, not in my way, I got my way
I was in my way, crept out my way, kept out my way
I'm on one like bae you're on your way, way, way, way

I'm fucking tired of all the perks
I've tried nothing, everything works
For less I'm worth, I've served my bid
All fuck life wasn't what it is
All fuck life was just a bridge
I seen some free landed some tricks
Far I see high time man quit
Won't let you know when I get goin
Phone ring too long

Don't you worry, impossible for anything to be a big deal
I'm in no weary, my vital post dated but clearly been ages since life had appeal
Far more than fascination my second nature chant kill cause I can
This body by my own hands
My friends and family won't understand
So I stay in the end, don't make none to me
If wasn't for them, I'd make that decision on GP
Had to do it all again, I'd make that decision on GP
All the nights I don't die for you
Wouldn't believe how many nights I ain't died for you on GP
Not that I care, I'd be a liar if I sat here claiming I'd exit in a minute
But I can't say I wouldn't I have my limits

Giving bad people...

Mausoleum treatment, strands of chemo
Unwell out my slit gashes tempo

Execution, my nerves I‚Äôm slurring
You deserve this, your worthless disturbs me


I want you to next time
It doesn‚Äôt sound so bad when I say it in my mind
I want you to next time
It doesn‚Äôt sound so bad when I say it in my mind


Mutter, stagger, I‚Äôm in you
I got you covered, scatter, you‚Äôre meant to
Pull a lick real quick
Made off I fling
Shallow plots for senile kings
Cruelty keeps me even
I moan like flukes
Euphoria follows puke
I won‚Äôt pull my chute


Giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
Giving bad people good ideas

Lead heavy lead us, remedy us
Hem me, I suffer to catch reflux

Bile threshold, cortex deluxe
Torture me lust

Overtoning mysteria

Headless
I skid like Rita lifted ocean
I drift like my planet don‚Äôt spin
I skid all over marks like I‚Äôm haunted
Rev it up, twirl my la la like profits
It‚Äôs never much, I‚Äôm war torn in the cockpit
Don‚Äôt interrupt, my turbulence slaps
My path massive demands panoramic
Massive
Shitty, you‚Äôre ten thousand leagues subzero sweat dripping
My hancock do-rag riptides like tent city
Standoff through low lands eerie silencing

Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes

Peel out, press me to magnetic slab
Severe swerving I tow lag
Off uncertainty 'til your zipper locks
My salvia silhouette commence shots
Sixty shots a second on this hexed clock
I strike ‚Äòtween each time your solar plex drops

Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes

I‚Äôm skidding out I can‚Äôt help yourself
I skid in doubt I‚Äôve dealt with yourself
I tricked hell out
I‚Äôm all helter skelter, I‚Äôm on that Faust
None of me left but reflex skidding out
Pulse in my chest feel like it‚Äôs fixing to bounce
Bounce, bitch, I can‚Äôt be the road
I‚Äôm crashing into planes, I crash and stroll
Maxed out my oath
Don‚Äôt blame me, I‚Äôve no soul

Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes

My skids 'til the brink, I jizz snowmen
Tall knives in my grill feel potent
My jigsaw manipulates you open
My skids rit rubbernecks agent orange
I skid like I‚Äôm no use
My headband expand like I choose juice
I binge, all black enhance my tragic
Ends to a means I can‚Äôt establish
Noise of nomads on sapphire spice
Cumulus in both hands, can‚Äôt kill myself twice
Pawns tremble like dildos wielded by duppies
Traumatized on for size, roadkill hides like yuppies
I‚Äôm too passcode, these gates won‚Äôt stay closed
Control gets old, I smash out my skin
My vessel thrown like slack at the wind
I‚Äôm finally astral now, grab my stems

Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes

Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping
Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping

Influence executed
Mass execution, rapid improvements
Toothless accent, drawl of a shaman
Putrid fanatic ride out like famine
Luminescent rattles, thunder in vials
Choose your battles or end in piles
Braided fumigation, destitution ramped
Desiccated satyr make a massacre dance

Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping

Psychotropic steel trap, rock a beat up bears hat
Naw man, I don‚Äôt feel this and I shit on your guilt trip
Then extinguish your illness like seven grams of thorazine
Tyrannic authority cleansed by your aggressor
Inhuman elitist decline your surrender
Sign of the freak thriving on a bender
Forbidden discipline, all lines disconnected
Vacated premises occupied by my death wish

Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping
Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping

Luster of entrails stacked and slung
Under cement veils my traffic hums
Compulsion on risers, your stranglers knuckles
Your temples buckle
Decompression silo inside this muzzle
Overdriven rituals on my torso, my infernal boro
If I went soft Glock to my navel
Flaws get knocked off, flaws get knocked off

Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping
Falling out in tune out my grooves, uhh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping

Cover me like skintight
Why my rep is like why they might be right

Shoot a glance at the desperate like

I wave them off, I wave them in
Gotta flake, I fuck ‚Äòem off ‚Äòcause I ain‚Äôt them

My approach like I‚Äôm ghost-like
I‚Äôm out of focus ‚Äòcause
I‚Äôm coated with the most stripes
Late movement on my trajectory
Anomalous like entropy
Make all things perforated
They apply iodine to trace this, I‚Äôm like, "Eh"

Posse up steadily feel your void split, I‚Äôm like...
Posse up steadily feel your void split, I‚Äôm like..."Eh"

Who you think you are?
Fucks like, "Do you know who I am?"
Fucks fail to understand

Who put your obese flex on ice?
Whose effortless corrupts your dice?
Who does you just like I told you?
Tell me, what‚Äôs it like, I'm like

Don‚Äôt be a, don‚Äôt be a
‚ÄòBout mummified worm in the sun
When shit‚Äôs up to me ‚Äòcause
I figure I‚Äôll watch you urn, I‚Äôm not concerned

Why fuss don‚Äôt be a medical procedure
Just stamp my fucking visa

Catch me hanging from my noose like, eh
How I vandalize full moon like
You‚Äôre so serious ease off
I don‚Äôt feed animals, you seem lost
I‚Äôm offended like, but in the end I‚Äôm like, eh

Polar jungle frozen punters
All my sculptures look so flustered
Code swallow dick, go get your boss
Security turn green ‚Äòcause I never floss
Fuck everything or I up the cost
Lack pedigree, my index push pause
Notch can‚Äôt talk, I‚Äôm smearing mute

Bloated bullshit I must maim
Ever met a prick on a metro trip

Fuck a warning, that bores me

Come test me, fucks get sliced
Caught a tiny cougar even she don‚Äôt wet

Obey me

My shock, my body clear
Obey me poison

Where's your heat at? It won't lit
I'm not surprised, check your thermostat, no digits
I drop a dime, you can have that, collect your tip
Go buy a rhyme and bring my cash back, you broke ass bitch

I sneak up on me
I shed my shh
My shock, my body clear
Obey me poison

Never betray me, oh and while you're at it
Double my inhibitor, I can't hack it
Be my buffer, my habit hunger havoc
I digress, I can't live in this contagion
I spread into incisions on occasion
Heavily stricken witness visions
Omens wall to wall followed by a loss of any and all symptoms
It won't lit

You're like, "Hold on. Fuck, it won't lit."
Stay put, you're the wrong one, bitch don't fit
Too shook, you're flows off blood, this won't hit
Got no hook, true or false, though you can't spit
Bitter face, Frida Kahlo the Costco remix, you're a case
All you got though free shit, what a waste
How can you not know? So which is it: love or hate?
You'd rather not know why shit won't lit, fucks hesitate

I sneak up on me
I shed my shh
My shock, my body clear
Obey me poison
Obey me poison
Obey me poison
Obey me, obey me

Obey me, obey me

Didn't mean to, I, I
Just assumed it'd be you, I, I
Never knew no idea, I, I
Was confused, excuses
It won't lit's a rubik's cubicle
For the new cog to chew off
To sulk with and flask on
How the sick with it put my mask on

Zach hit them off like, "It won't lit," they shit bricks
Bbpoltergiest don't touch this, don't insist
Favorite the copyright then go home, bitch, no homeless
I'm in your house like, "Oh shit, I own this"
I'll kick your ass out, don't bitch, bitch, it's winter, bitch
Take my trash out real quick or live in it
Where's my cash out promo slip? I'm skipping shit
When I'm tacked out, my it won't lit's it won't lit

Nylons on
Side bitches don‚Äôt
Your table through my
My body through your
Three bedrooms in a good neighborhood
On fire like a margarita made out of wood
She got solar panels for thirty cents a watt
In the future, there‚Äôs a party from the past, she‚Äôs a cop

I‚Äôll jail break ADX with a blank tarot card
Same card pull your hoe card like Zoltar
Two crystal balls dangle from my boneyard
I‚Äôm niagara falls flowing crowbar
La la la la, I got folsom bars
Tour flows urinal take a dive bars

Swiftly service me, bitch it‚Äôs called outlaw

This private ocean I carve
I‚Äôll carve this bitch into high art
No say bitch made state of mind art
My murder spree murk out this conk
Albert Fish gaunt sunk out this conk
Strictly ugly fuck for your cunt
Cunts over easy and more blunts
Thermal strong arm gravity sink bong
Head games with an only child
I foghorn devils devils jelly
Felt me, unbelt me, bombard your belly
Force feed me through your telly
Cyborg swelling pregnant can‚Äôt abort

America, America, now I‚Äôm coming Africa
My death is money
Whose bad? His bad
Who‚Äôs looking shitty? Not me
You think he‚Äôs listening? Probably
Mouthpiece on Sally‚Äôs like San Joaquin valley
Fuck your middle man, throw that towel in, you irk me
Yeah, yeah, go tell a friend
You‚Äôre irrelevant, ain‚Äôt shit but a skank
Skank way too far from her holding tank
Come on, girl, get your front on, girl
You rank A-list or so I hear
But no basic here, no safe bets here
Wouldn‚Äôt touch a fake bitch with latex here

She's so, she's so

Beat thirsty, thought I heard a mosquito

Party full of thirsty, lurkers hella worried
All in six high glass heels
Cinderella water hole climbing for a pot of goldie
Flip you for a twenty bill
Aim for El Dorado estimated arrival
Time it take a fuck to make a deal
Ain‚Äôt gonna make it though, try your luck in porn
You‚Äôre so thirsty, all you‚Äôll ever earn is frills

Check two skeeze
Pop that pussy pitch into a tent
How those poles make you so bent
Push that cart peddles you ring the bell
Ring the bell though, hands full of dick
Use your elbows, door to door you sand every last floor
Deep as you can choke a quicksand storm
Lipstick lap dance won‚Äôt record

She‚Äôs so, she‚Äôs so
Beat thirsty, thought I heard a mosquito
She know we know
But her vox so desert and our beats so dro
She‚Äôs so, she‚Äôs so

Struck books of match in you
Subwoofer I‚Äôm dry humping
‚ÄòLectrify me, I‚Äôm fucking
Apparitions fire
We desire agony exposure
Ground flesh in heat
Human flesh wreath can‚Äôt go nowhere
Too iron to rant, I lift my hammer
Drives us red, bottomless pit rising
Out and through my hammer, like the dead

I fucked you in half

Slippery when panickin', this seems like surfin' gasoline
At the mercy of my discrepancy
I've got countless current identities
Which one should I pretend to be?
Which will be the end of me?
Fuck my present coordinates
I will 'em dead like, like, like, like, like, like, like
It's not what you think
Fuck you want from us?
We're the same as you
But we know we're fucked
But we came as you, like you know it's us
And your mind, not you

My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life
My whole life, my whole fuckin' life

Cut one, spill revelations, it's fucked
Center seal of my imagination, fucked
Forehead of mine submergin', I'm sinkin'
Noah's Ark, blood's virgin, stop thinkin'
See now? There ya go
It's alright, your write-offs belong to vultures
My whole life like vultures
Brain coverage is more like
My vision ain't no good on my sore side
There ya go, there ya go, there ya go, there ya go
There ya go, there ya go, there ya go, there ya go
There ya go, there ya go, there ya go, there ya go
Cut one, spill revelations, it's fucked
Center seal of my imagination, fucked
Forehead of mine submergin', I'm sinkin'
Noah's Ark, blood's virgin, stop thinkin'
See now? There ya go
It's alright, your write-offs belong to vultures
My whole life like vultures
Brain coverage is more like
My vision ain't no good on my sore side

This ghost town's my compound, I'm a saboteur
Your town's my smoke cloud, I stay at war
By night shift I don't exist, chump, saddle up
A dust to dust motionless struck belly up
Your skies are lip balm on my balls
Elemental cyclotron on white walls
I met you and your carne asada to cry
Fuck everything, now go ahead and pay us for my shrine, wait
This ghost town's my compound, I'm a saboteur
Your town's my smoke cloud, I stay at war
By night shift I don't exist, chump, saddle up
A dust to dust motionless struck belly up
Birch wood emoji wrought with human branches
Your innocence save your hopes, I just throw the dice
And I've been like this for my whole fucking life
My whole fucking life's your whole fucking life

Panic, panic, panic, panic
Panic, panic, panic, panic
You know this bitch, this is the bitch you know
I would not fuck a basic bitch, bring a bitch and I want more
Uptight bitch, your blood's like bitch, right? Zip tight flow
Handle a bitch, handle a bitch, handle a bitch like so
I'm not no bitch like that
That bitch go, they start off and strip like plat'
Fuckin' with C-notes, like please don't, that bitch might act
Handle a bitch, I'll handle a bitch, I'll handle a bitch like that
Woah, I'm dead, bitch
Your blood's like bitch, right?

Last bitch feel branded or somethin'
That bitch more ate up than my lunch
That bitch make me take my time
Makin' for change, they gonna come
Bitch always been assed out
Kiss your black ass on the mouth
Shit, had bitch, that bitch is broke
Said, broke bitch, I'm on that dope

Bitches more sick
I round 'em up and spin real quick just like a mat
They feed that flame and get loud as fuck
Kool-Aid, bitch, I blaze a bat
Bitches more sick
I round 'em up and spin real quick just like a mat
They feed that flame and get loud as fuck
Kool-Aid, bitch, I blaze a bat
Bitches, I round 'em up and spin real quick just like a mat

Kool-Aid, bitch, I blaze a bat
He's a bitch, she's a bitch, sorry bitch

Exist like a drunk man at the wheel
But first sittin' in the front, not at the wheel
No clue I could fuck you 'cause I will
Fuck praise, all it does is pay my bills
I faced the crowd in Vegas there
Ever fake but isn't where
Shit ain't raw, they can't compare
Check AWOL, bitch, I'm always there
Intangible intrusion to the bone, through the bone
Feels human bones, human skill
Blessed on windmill and opium feel
Bumpin' shit, I leave open seal
Ghoulishly austere, paralysis is my souvenir
Exit wounds and rabbit ears
Rabbit holes that last for years
Now can you see I have no fears?
Not havin' cares, post-stratosphere
(Witness post-stratosphere)
Misspoke language of savoir faire
Don't need to come with the stolen hair
Stranger slip by, catch my interest
Look for a minute at a safe distance
Lose my place, look back, see no one
Death won't wait, will adapt when it closer
Death won't wait, will adapt when it closer
Death won't wait, will adapt when it closer
Milk that daylight, jump this vanish
I like this type, that's refined manner
Sullen every way, steppin' off when it happens
Sullen every way, steppin' off when it happens
Sullen every way, steppin' off when it happens
This is why I'm swimming in a faucet of acid
I bum a dialogue instead of renting it
Call in the place and get an estimate
It's diligent on paper, I'll invest in it
Be weird if I could make it as a mesmerist
Have a tall list of clients to tamper with
Be a practicing confessional
Cultivator of masochists
Crave sanity? I'll make you vegetables
Your family'll think like pacifists
Cool long as I don't move my tongue
Cool long as I don't bite my tongue

I'm into shit like this
Rise with me, you skinned it thick
Rights of passage, I've been through it
Might have abused that shit
I'm into shit like this
Rise with me, you skinned it thick
Rights of passage, I've been through it
Might have abused that shit
I'm into shit like this
Rise with me, you skinned it thick
Rights of passage, I've been through it
Might have abused that shit
I'm into shit like this
Rise with me, you skinned it thick
Rights of passage, I've been through it
Might have abused that shit

Dirt, dirt, hot pothead girls
Smoke yours, it's split with the bald-head girl
Dirt, dirt, hot pothead girls
Smoke yours, it's split with the bald-head girl
You want to know who I am?

No one's girl, stoic girl
Only fucks fine foreign girls
Makes your muse, play it ruse
Awakens your fantasy, bathe in you like Bathory
Bathe in you like Bathory, bathe in you like Bathory
Bathe in you like Bathory, bathe in you like Bathory
Bathe in you like Bathory, bathe in you like Bathory
Bathe in you like Bathory, bathe in you like Bathory

Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl
Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl

Attention
I am the dragon from the desert

Hate makes me reckless, restraint cease the functions
You get the best of me, but I'm missin' one in my stomach
Killer for the occasion, whip you back to size
Break you like a Franklin, spend you like a five
They like, "How come? How come, though?"
They come at meals, fuck no
Right on, I'm that killer, you're a fucking sidearm
Think twice, face down
Don't bleed like this Cape Town
Don't sleep like no playground

Dirt, dirt, hot pothead girls
Smoke yours, it's split with the bald-head girl
Dirt, dirt, hot pothead girls
Smoke yours, it's split with the bald-head girl

Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl
Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl

Farewell, fuck you hopeless
On three, spread out, then move in
Strategy, cauterize all loose strands
Finder's life can't be too thin
My spotlight proof to no end
Pursue this life with no friends
Bet your own at your own risk
'Cause farewell, fuck you hopeless
And act like no one notice
On three, spread out, then move in
Strategy, cauterize all loose strands
Finder's life can't be too thin
My spotlight proof to no end
Pursue this life with no friends
Bet your own at your own risk
'Cause farewell, fuck you hopeless

Me and my doppelg√§nger have a system
My shoulder pain loads ammunition
These counterfeits are mostly sober
I pen the script, he pilots the saucer
It's funny, the bored pose of my dead man
We both scramble until I'm the last man
Stay in first so much I have four left hands
He arose disgusted, I awoke in Bethlehem

Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl
Bald-head girl, no one's girl
Stoic girl, ocean girl

Don't ask me where I came from
Ignore me anyway but
Stick it if you think it
Happens when you can't stop

Came to in a sports cage
Five minutes, coulda swore it was a decade
Had the time of my life, no head case
Zoom with the camp where we jump for fuck's sake
Threw it off over end of the hard way
Lie back, then I shut down my heart rate
Enter threshold of blind man's hallway
Hell'll turn a tightrope to my causeway
Two burned rascals call me hombre
And now you're fuckin' with mojo
Side shift like bold fungus moonglow
I flatline straight through to the loophole

Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Personalized like genetics and provide all your needs
Don't be frightened by skeptics, listen essentially
You're sleeping on a goldmine

Tone of our voices means our location's a runaway
I'm before all your destinations, I'll be on display
I'm fuckin' on your schedule, explanation's in delay
Pathway enchanted encounter, feed that hoe a chainsaw
Burned up at myself, back to the floor
Moment I do, my bustle was such a bore
Pull that way, run your vehicles 'cause you know it's cool
Put my fist on a pedestal 'til I stroke the core

Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Come and go whenever to wherever you please
Personalized like genetics and provide all your needs
Don't be frightened by skeptics, listen essentially
You're sleeping on a goldmine

No matter what, stay where you are, if you go
Don't matter who you shot, there's no scars where you are
Never felt this, but I been so lost, nothing's broke
Make your life a demand, things don't blow to be all gone

A hybrid night container
Carbonated thrift store
Your peter is the peak
Of hubris marked in vain
Hi

Sick like, sick like

Fall out on impact
Never been left, what's worse
You must have that contention
That greenscape, that witch fur
What if I was strapped like toothpaste?
Like filler ass, dig grave
I feel staffed like Rick James

Sick like, sick like

Chinchilla, rich blood
Mindset, core forms
Timeless, but I admire
Improvised explosives
Glowed off, my darlins
Good labor, my harlot
Blood form
With the ice flow garnet

Sick like, sick like

Molten like karma, it's abstractions of bliss to me
Intolerance removes lava, high pressure like quick release
Counterstrike red Bambaataa on those tears
Get by, stampede off billions
Stagnant eyes, spring rupture, drop off here
Said my deadbeat

Sick like, sick like
Sick like, sick like
Sick like, sick like

Doubtful, you stand in pride
Turnin' me down so quiet
Silence guided by vision
Assailant inside the figure
Can't hide from suspicion
War-waging prescription
Street life breaks you like religion

Sick like, sick like

Hooded figure exploit your demons
Cast profit, go to buy, try, can't knock it
Bet a bitch forward this market
Better get numbered, you're profit
The offer day
The offer day, you're numbered
Try to flee, but you can't leave
You get paid to suffer

At the time, didn't recognize myself 'til I was petrified
But half the time I'm not myself
So most of the time I don't question why
We did testify, but best I can do is buy some time
Spend my time folding time
Even met myself one time
Black body, body
Black body, body
Black body, body
Black body, body

Nothing matters anymore
You can't see the kraken
Climbing out the bullshit that exists from the mouth
You can't get out of debt
Just learn to keep on stabbing
In the heart with a fucking knife
You drop it before you can catch it
Do you see what's taxing?
All life's a moment before the grave
You're only optimally the passenger, a slave
From the middle finger
Open up the sewers before you, drop this ring, reave
The culture hiding behind this life, kill the pain

All I see are sycophants
Hunting for that little bit
Never will get sick of it
Take it like the middle one
Learned about how sick it is
Every word is cinema
Find me off a precipice
Flying like the state of drugs

And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it

Dance, you motherfucker
Get on 'em, motherfucker
Get 'em like a man
Petite like Southern, hit up like clan
Ya'll nations are stuck in gutters fastened by checks
Desert creek kumbaya, feed that snake like mud
I'm too sick now to eat, I inspect my money just 'cause

Question must be scroungin'
Nobody came to flex, it's poundin'
But I bet that's next, the mountain flecks
Off this map's rips, it's grounded
By the thousands, they walked in the valley
Act like you care while I get you out of it
Like I said, get the fuck off my couch
Ain't worth shit if it ain't about me

All I see are sycophants
Hunting for a little bit
Never get sick of it
Take it like the middle one
Fucks you admitted for?
All I see are sycophants
Hunting for a little bit
Never get sick of it
Take it like the middle one
Learned about how sick it is
Every word is cinema
Find me off a precipice
Flying like the state of drugs

I'd rather not get involved
I'm not that much, never been that much
But I saw too much to pay shit off
Too stuck, no way, weigh off that much
What can I say? Fuck what you say
You can ask around if you think I'm frontin'
Never been that much, but I got here first
Get the fuck out, bitch, while I do my work

And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it
And I move with it, and I move with it

More than the fairy
More than the fairy

Go make that face

I got my hands on this bitch
Impressed with me, all of these insects
Act as if I never meant to
I never meant to be soft
I sent you texts then it filled you with those
And it must bass

I know it sounds crazy at the river bank
Ain't thought 'bout shit for a minute, mane
Mane

Twice the thickness Nyquil
Limited discount time kill
I'm here for 24 hours
Letdowns line up like coward
Amnesia put the address
Express level crash test
You tell me I can't call it
All I do is talk shit

More than the fairy

More than the fairy
Go make that face
Go make that bass
Go make that face, go
More than the fairy
Make that face
Go make that bass
Go make that face
More than the fairy
Go make that face
Go make that bass
Go make that face, go
More than the fairy
Make that face
Go make that bass
Go make that face

Forged all my signatures, blah blah blah
Strangled from this track of smoke rising
Hard to see 'em proper
Tried to swallow his only pills, though

Mane

Ungluing my person in this city strapped with strange lies
Reluctantly searching for what eluded me last night
Perfectly for decades
Bully ain't trapped that trip yet
Put this life behind me
But I know that's just a half step

Make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face

I‚Äôm doing handstands on her trans am
Pretty pretty nine, spinning spinning blind
Fitting into crime, itch to fuck and grind
Death Grips is online, drinking from its spine
Living till I‚Äôm fine, pretty pretty nine
Color me a cult, echo in my throat
Cut it for a smoke took it for a spin
Spun it out to float, blew me as a friend
Fuck it I‚Äôm a go, Death Grips is online
Black Madonna womb, collar for a goon
Suck it till you‚Äôre stole, steal me a new role
Hunger of a chain through this mud cling
Don‚Äôt let you pose on a blue rose
Lick a lick a grim set it chrome again
Chemical to learn load it up and gleam
Sprinter out a curve shooting up a scene
Bitter end to share, blotter in the air

Punks get nailed all in the daytime
And I got good friends who love to headline with a

Pretty pretty nine pity pity motherfucker
Pretty pretty nine in your city motherfucker
No laws here air soft start popping off
That flack get quit snitches wear
Pretty pretty nine
Pretty pretty nine

Punks get nailed all in the daytime
And I got good friends who love to headline with a

Dirty dirty strip mall sugar
Melody to hail, symphony to dick
Jealousy to file entropy to flip
Felony you buy, Indica I rip
Hella hella hot flagging like i‚Äôm not
Vanish as I can damage as I been
Ultra other shit minus all the trim
Catalyst to milk memory to stiff
Break it to the hilt fuck it like a kiss
Paper tiger boss pussy wanna front
Shake it like the law only cool to hunt
Take it like a hint miss it get the dick
Climber get a jerk super ape as shit
Nightly on a tram, knuckle white the stance
Phaedra ‚Äòhind the cam work us in a trance
Lock us in her van drive us outer space
Day we never land, only thing I‚Äôll taste

Punks get nailed all in the daytime
And I got some friends who'd love to headline with a

Pretty pretty nine pity pity motherfucker
Pretty pretty nine in your city motherfucker
No laws here air soft start popping off
That flack get quit snitches wear
Pretty pretty nine
Pretty pretty nine

Got good friends who'd love to headline

Should the opportunity arise, vomit me flies
Flies vomit me, together‚Äôs unwise, sever all ties
Should the opportunity arise, vomit me flies
Flies vomit me, vomit green eyes

Half-lidded coolers, half lies as cures
Warm blanket statement, Denver air terminal patient
Rubberized, skin rubberized
For your entertainment, got two cents save it
Dozing at the helm, road paved with vagrants
Closed casket make up, lavish euthanasia
Necro Winnebago, worship on shroom in safe zones
Hilo loose brown recluse, murdered out rainbows

Should the opportunity arise, vomit me flies
Flies vomit me, together‚Äôs unwise, sever all ties
Should the opportunity arise, vomit me flies
Flies vomit me, vomit green eyes

Cyanide protocol, capsule wipe too involved
Can‚Äôt hear answer I, try for wait signal my
Wait for my signal try, too late to whisper why
Besides don‚Äôt waste this fry, had to take it all at once
As yet unknown, as yet as fuck, back in the town
Now what, know what, no rush
So what, what now, fuck now

Blackish green spirits of Krak√≥w
Only fog I‚Äôve felt with features
Exception complexion of silver drinkers
Oppressive dense fog with modest demeanor

Should the opportunity arise, vomit me flies
Flies vomit me, together‚Äôs unwise, sever all ties
Should the opportunity arise, vomit me flies
Flies vomit me, Vomit green eyes

Trust me trust me you know us well
We purge herds of stunted cells
We nurse the worm until it swells
(Eat it like the devil's cunt)
First to kneel cursed to feel
Trust me trust us we know you will
Tide come crashing in like steel
Makes your passions taste so stale
(Eat it like the devil's cunt)
Cobwebs turn your insides pale

If significant piece of me spill
Little pinot pouring out my gills
Pass a carafe perhaps I‚Äôll swill
My grief may leak but can‚Äôt congeal
Word nihil you know the drill
To last rattle on a long swig tail
Till last drop wind through mine like scales
Compromise your position become theirs

Day breaking glyph hissing
Sanity fucking bitch skinning
How do you say come to me
Hanging out with Linda
I heard she‚Äôs in fucking custody

Need new escape we‚Äôre a trained magician
I‚Äôve just the uranium griffin
Land you there in ribbons
Where your thoughts stay hidden
Fair for a square made soft for digging
Word nihil you know the drill
Amp cooking guilt gives a
Thunder stealing window licker
Her moods big for real
Head hunting blunt kissing
Death dumping body gripping

Head hunting blunt kissing
Death dumping body gripping
How does she say come to me
Boosting with Linda‚Äôs in custody

Must admit shit‚Äôs not luck how we
Manage to elude locked up in county
Every chance a fuck gets I‚Äôm counting
Sleight of hand sleight of hand from the valley

February 20th, Los Angeles, California
I'm in the studio with Death Grips
They're working on their new album at Sunset Sound Studios
6650 Sunset Boulevard
They have a dilemma, but they'll win their dilemma

Dilemma

Butterfly ballistic, seax survival
Butcher kukri to trench homicidal
Can't say I buy them, just show up lately
Lately seem to stalk me like I'm yeti
Like scream of a haunted jetty
Let me be a haunted jetty
Cross I cry banshee like manic falcon
Shrill like losing time on Shasta Mountain

Thingany thingany, so jinx now
She's wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wild
Pinky ring, pinky ring, show it out
My suh-suh-suh-suh-suh style

Shine like sad hung from starry eyed gallows
Like day old glow of carbon eye shadow
Trembling young wounded mammal
Double edge gut judge choke on his gavel (Choke)
Jack slide leave atlantic puddles
Spade slip lives into stranded shuttles
I taxiderm shams with morbid shinto
This three quarter shank, one quarter disco (Choke)
Low res mega evil patina
Pattern maker of myth and trip weaver
Infamous nature in rags like reaper
Like midnight mounted by wayside seekers

Lovely, lovely, they're so blonde
It's ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
Dusty, dusty, so far gone
I'm fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fucking wrong

It's ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
It's ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
It's ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
It's ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
It's ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
It's ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
These knives bleed knives
They cut me, I'll cut you
Below is above you
Above is below me
I'm dying to try on these knives
You don't know me

Dilemma
Dilemma

Thingany thingany, so jinx now
She's wahwah wah-wah-wah-wild
Pinky ring, pinky ring, show it out
My suh-suh-suh-suh-suh style

Little Richard took a picture
He got triggered by the click'a
He got beat up, he got bigger

Little Richard
Little Richard

Little Richard, he's in the dorms
He's gonna bomb and look good when he bombs
In the dorms
Maria Sharapova, yes
As good as anyone's guess

Little Richard
Little Richard

He just needs to A, B, C, and D
He just needs the world to be what he has seen

In the horn section
They hide weapons
Bottom of a white bic
Chewed up like a pig's dick

Little Richard
Little Richard

I don't know dude, I just- I just drink blood dude

The fear (jump, jump, jump)
I'm gonna kill somebody (jump, jump, jump)
DON'T JUMP!

Downs you with dull pain
Won't we become strange
Tied up with your legs
Hide helps, on the way
Who will help you fall?
It's just all so frail
So long since we fell
Still don't know we failed
Go for the most tears
Stay cause it gets strange
Went there to shed years
Left there in lead chains
Been there since next year
Scarred us to death chair
Scared us to rest less
Skull full of house guests

The fear
The fear

I feel so sick today
I'm afraid to be here with you
You wanna kill somebody
I'm afraid to be here with you
I feel so sick today
I'm afraid to be here with you
You wanna kill somebody
I'm afraid to be here with you

DON'T JUMP!
Jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump
The fear

Pulled close by its pliers
Cold, sharp, and expired
Like ribs of vampire
Like winds on high wire
Whips you like it cares
Push you down more stairs
Kicks you for quick laughs
Don't cry you won't last (The fear)
Missing entire weeks
Months gone as I peak
Lost tongue, mystery
Everyone's on to me (The fear)
Who's this stole my heels
Stumbled into hell
Hates me till it heals
Wakes me with the chills (The fear)

I feel so sick today
I'm afraid to be here with you
You wanna kill somebody
I'm afraid to be here with you
I feel so sick today
I'm afraid to be here with you
You wanna kill somebody
I'm afraid to be here with you

Frightening and embarrassing
Like one percent and pleasantries
Gather your things bolt till you reach
The crystal fields of ketamine
I'll meet you there, I'll beat you there
Bet I'll be there before you leave
Time you get there I‚Äôll be midair
Like peace of mind's a bore to me

The fear
The fear
Jump, jump
DON'T JUMP!

When the rail holds you
Flight like stairs grows you
Off your mind must wish
This is not my ditch
Ah that ditch wears you
Host torn and worn through
Hard looks at blank walls
Held way too long pause
The fear
The fear

Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah disappointed
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah disappointed
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah disappointed
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah disappointed

Called shots cheap shots
Slack jaws low blows
Weak chins chin checked
Chin up like cholos
No life signs left
Ah yes, try mine
This thresh hold thresh
Hold stretch life times
Machine human malformed machine
Uninformed unit forlorn regime
Metamorph me into done for at last
At least until my present shore has past

WHY ME?
WHY ME?
WHY ME?
WHY ME?
WHYYYYYYYY ME?

Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah disappointed
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah disappointed
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah disappointed
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah disappointed

Nut job, no job
Fuck jobs, not hired
Low lands, road rash
War path crossfire
Nonthreats, hot mess
Known threats, stalk less
Talk less, show less
Snatch yours trap doors
Ripper ripper skin tight, too tight
Too tight holding solid moonlight moonlight
Moonlight, kevlar coated slit moon, lunar gush
Lunar gush carry on carrion never been far enough
Hocus breaking in and centering
Broke in and gave up on everything, everything

WHYYYYYYYY ME?
WHY ME?
WHY ME?
WHY ME?
WHY ME?

Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah disappointed
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah disappointed
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah disappointed

Rot clot your husk
Scorned husk born shook
Torn trick core breached
Shook fuck shit head
Bitch too short street
Shut fuck up or fed
Both you're

Disappointed

(That's me)
(And that's all you)
Can I break it down?

Can I break it, can I break it down?

Nah, n-nah, n-nah, wh-what it do?
Humiliation, I refuse
Inside shaking, nah, I'm cool, got this
I'm not you
Bow down, give it-give it to me, baby
I gotta do my girl, she's down
B-B-Been only since I-
In the truck
Give me some more, I said it's calm
Callers at the door (Can I break it down?)
Jump on 'em, my bumps in the whip
Crazy from the heat, talk to the... ergh
(Can I break it, can I break it down?)
Perversion mastiff, seven fingers left
Still curtain pumping, n'oh, I lay Jesus fresh to death
And God is panic, they gon' tremble
Here me swear you seen the devil
Hear me step-to with it, fatal
These faces roundtable

(And that's all you)
(That's me)

Can I break it, can I break it down? (Oh, Mya)

Try to break this cycle, broke me
Told me, "You'll see," you don't know me
Kinda freaky, she's bony
So sh-she on me (on me)
Listen closely
Why don't we, one night only?
(Can I break it, can I break it down?)

Runnin' out of, runnin' out of
Runnin' out of, runnin' out of
-ck around and lose my mind, I'm on that
(Can I break it, can I break it down?)
Runnin' out of, runnin' out of
Runnin' out of, runnin' out of
You're runnin' out of tricks
(Oh, Mya)

Jungling out of my shoulders
Light at the end of the tunnel's
A lie, I look forward to runnin' 'em over
Eye of the storm of the dolo
There you go, there you go
Down that road, down that road
(Can I break it down?)
Lost in exhaust with the windows closed
Shut the door, nothing more I can do
Try to see why it would be like this
Tell her roam like palindrome, back and forth
Like all that be, I can see from my back porch
Do it that, do it, I can't try no more
Difficult to live it slow, I'm so bored
If I'm not ever squattin' on my bike
Ridin' 'round like, "Kid, well, now I have no life"

(And that's all you)
(That's me)
(And that's all you)
Can I break it, can I break it down? (Oh, Mya)
(And that's all you)
(That's me)
Can I break it down?
(And that's all you)
Can I break it, can I break it down? (Oh, Mya)

Cha-ching slot, micro dot
Bet and lost my spleen in Reno
All them dimes for your casino
Jungle bars, we mescalina
Thin walls, heaving
Linoleum splitting
Lost in dead
Space emitting a metallic smell, can't take its sickness

Runnin' it, runnin' him over
Can I break it, can I break it down?
Runnin' it, runnin' him over
Can I break it, can I break it down?
Runnin' it, runnin' him over
Can I break it, can I break it down?
Can I break it, can I break it down?

Runnin' out of, runnin' out of
Runnin' out of, runnin' out of
-ck around and lose my mind, I'm on that
(Can I break it, can I break it down?)
Runnin' out of, runnin' out of
Runnin' out of, runnin' out of
You're runnin' out of tricks
(Oh, Mya)

666, I'm at the gates
9, the gate's coming down
8, I escape
11, I'll never be found
7, I die
13, swallow my tail
15, I'm on fire
51, I'm off the scale

(Oh, Mya)
(And that's all you)
(That's me)
(And that's all you)
Can I break it, can I break it down? (Oh, Mya)
(And that's all you)
Runnin' it, runnin' him over (That's me)
(And that's all you)
Can I break it, can I break it down? (Oh, Mya)
(And that's all you)
Runnin' it, runnin' him over (That's me)
Down (And that's all you)
Can I break it, can I break it down? (Oh, Mya)
(And that's all you)
Runnin' it, runnin' him over (That's me)
Down (And that's all you)
Can I break it, can I break it down?

Feels like a wheel
Let me live my life

I am overflow, undertow shots licked
Where'd he go? Federal cloaked key and lock shit
Dope hot shit

La creepin under my skin
La creepin under my skin
La creepin under my skin
La creepin under my skin

La creepin under my skin
One way ticket to big island
Cut off eyelid still I can't see
Try to realize before dead weight
Bout out of time speed checkmate
Internal fall out can't escape
Jungle call fuck back indoors
Nothing round here I must see more

So harsh in here think I've gone mad
Can't tell if I went too far
Lost my phone man shits all bad
No landline no mac no car
No map show where skullfuck I am
Alone can't cut off both my hands
I'm in the fuckin big house

On your feet
Overlord
Government plates
On location
I'm a corporation
Fuck location

I don't need your help

Hand yourself over remain calm I only plan to steal whatever I want
Fuck whos watching
I lose it I can't remember why
No agenda still can't remember I
Uncross my fingers
Heard you claim we've met before
Always forget who they are
Lay
My head in furnace
Cream
Proof of purchase
Ghost in machine
Laced
When I spit on your face
You'll take what you can get
Not once have I been had yet
My skull in nylon my throat like pipe bomb
Give it give it to me till you're all used up
Play play no amuse me don't forget to fuck off
Whatever I want
